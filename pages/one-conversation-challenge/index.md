  Videos That Matter challenges you to have one conversation in 2018 that has
  the potential to bring about healing, peace, or freedom in your life. The
  conversation can be anything you make it, whether it involves talking to
  friends or family about an uncomfortable topic or reaching out to reconcile
  guilt from the past. Whatever it may be we challenge you to have the
  conversation and find healing through honest connection.
