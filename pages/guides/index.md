We do this through collaboration with artists as a means to support and promote their work, as well as, connect them with issues of societal concern. 
 
Storytelling through music videos and animations gives us the opportunity to work with musicians, actors, illustrators, dancers, poets, and filmmakers to create awareness in a way not commonly seen. We partner our videos with conversation guides, a tool used to enhance the education of the topic at hand. 
 
Our content can be used within a variety of curriculums including, but not limited to, schools, churches, and organizations. To learn more about using our content please visit our outreach page. 
 
VTM is powered by Core Communities, a non-profit organization helping communities thrive through conversations and connection.
