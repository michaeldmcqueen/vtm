Just as no one person is an island, no one organization is able to make changes all on their own. We need the support of individuals and groups who long for the same kind of lasting impact as we do. The work of our own skilled teams is amplified when we come together and our videos, content, and curriculum will have the chance to go that much further and deeper with your help.

If you love this work, if you love collaboration between artists, if you love innovative conversations, if you love positively impacting the health of your community, then you are the one we need. Consider utilizing your resources to sponsor the work of VTM and contact us at info@corecommunities.org to discuss various methods of ongoing financial contribution. Together we can create momentum for activation and change.

We want to thank all of our current sponsors:
