Our project, Videos That Matter, is a platform for us to communicate the needs and values of our communities. 
 
Open Source Creative Content:
CoreCommunities wants to tell the stories that are important to you. We are committed to offering our Videos That Matter to the general public, government agencies, and service-based organizations. Groups and organizations are free to use our general content, shown here (hyperlink) to support broad communications and outreach efforts. The content cannot be used for commercial purposes or altered in anyway without specific permission to do so. 
 
Commissioned Creative Content:
Our creative video production services are available to groups and organizations seeking visual representation for specific initiatives and topics. Our team offers quality, original content that communicates your vision and helps you to start the conversations that matter most to you. See our portfolio of commissioned work here (hyperlink).
